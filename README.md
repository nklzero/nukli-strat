# Nukli-Strat Project

**Nukli-Strat** is an **experimental research project** exploring a meta-architecture and declarative specification system for **verifiable, deterministic, and interoperable software**.

> ⚠️ **Research & Exploration Stage**
> This project is currently in an **active research and experimentation phase**.  
> All materials (specifications, grammar, and tooling) are **non-commercial** and **subject to change** as the architecture and language evolve toward stability.

* **Nukli** provides the *truth-preserving framework* (SIEV: Specification → Implementation → Execution → Verification).
* **Strat** defines *typed, deterministic contracts* for data, functions, and system interfaces (Specification layer of SIEV).
